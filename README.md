## 🎯 Objective

The goal of these labs was to understand and implement fundamental ML techniques  
for **classification, regression, and clustering**, while analyzing their performance and decision boundaries.

Covered topics include:
- Linear & Logistic Regression  
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- Decision Trees & Random Forests  
- k-Means & PCA for unsupervised learning
